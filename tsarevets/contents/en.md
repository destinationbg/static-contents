The fortress was built in the 12th century by the Second Bulgarian Empire, during the reign of Tsar Ivan Asen II. It served as the primary residence of the Bulgarian emperors and the spiritual and political center of the empire. The fortress was protected by a massive wall and several towers, and within its walls were located the palace of the tsar, the patriarchal palace, and a number of other important buildings.

Tsarevets Fortress played a crucial role in Bulgarian history, particularly during the 13th century, when the empire was at the height of its power. The fortress was the site of several battles, including the successful defense against the Byzantine Empire in 1230. However, in the 14th century, the fortress fell to the invading Ottoman Turks, marking the end of the Second Bulgarian Empire.

Despite its loss to the Ottomans, Tsarevets Fortress remained an important symbol of Bulgarian identity and resistance. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, during the Bulgarian National Revival, the fortress became a symbol of the Bulgarian struggle for independence from the Ottoman Empire.
