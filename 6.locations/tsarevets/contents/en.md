## Tsarevets: A Medieval Stronghold in Northern Bulgaria

### Introduction

Tsarevets is a medieval stronghold situated on a hill with the same name in Veliko Tarnovo, northern Bulgaria. Standing at 206 meters above sea level, it served as the Second Bulgarian Empire's primary fortress and most robust bulwark between 1185 and 1393. The fortress housed the royal and patriarchal palaces and is currently a popular tourist attraction.

### Early History and Settlement

The earliest evidence of human presence on Tsarevets Hill dates back to the 2nd millennium BC. It was settled in the 4th century, and by the end of the 5th century, a Byzantine city, tentatively identified as Zikideva, was built on its grounds. The construction of the Bulgarian stronghold began in the 12th century, following the Vlach-Bulgarian Rebellion and the establishment of the Second Bulgarian Empire, with its capital in Veliko Tarnovo.

Tsarevets Fortress quickly became the most crucial stronghold in Bulgaria, often compared in magnificence with Rome and Constantinople. However, in 1393, Ottoman forces besieged the stronghold for three months before finally conquering and burning it down on 17 July, marking the fall of the Bulgarian Empire.

### Fortress Layout and Architecture

The stronghold features three entrances, with the main entrance located on the easternmost side of the hill. The castle complex is situated in the center, enclosed by an internal stone wall, two battle towers, and two entrances (north and south). It comprises a throne hall, a castle church, and the king's chamber.

In the 14th century, Tsarevets was the largest castle in Bulgaria, with Kings Petar, Asen, Kaloyan, and Ivan Asen II residing there. Restoration efforts began in 1930 and were completed in 1981 to commemorate the 1300th anniversary of the Bulgarian state's establishment.

Thick walls up to 3.6 meters girdle the entire stronghold, which was served by three gates. The main gate, featuring a draw-bridge, was located at the hill's westernmost part on a narrow rock massif. The second gate is 180 meters away from the first one, while the third gate, which existed until 1889, is 450 meters further.

#### The Palace

The palace is on the hill's central and plain part, forming a closed complex encircled by a fortified wall, two towers, and two entrances (a main one from the north and one from the south). It housed a throne room, a palace church, and a royal residential part, covering an area of 4,872 square meters.

#### The Patriarchate and Cathedral of the Ascension of the Lord

The patriarchate, a complex with an area of about 3,000 square meters, is situated at the top of the hill. The Cathedral of the Ascension of the Lord, built on the remains of a late Roman basilica, was reconstructed in 1981 and painted in 1985. The frescoes inside, painted in a striking modernist style, depict conventional Christian subjects and the glorious and tragic moments of the Second Bulgarian Empire. The church has not been reconsecrated.

#### Baldwin's Tower

Baldwin's Tower, a modern reconstruction of a medieval tower modeled after the tower in Cherven and built in 1930, is in the southeastern part of the fortress. It marks the location of the original medieval tower where Latin Emperor Baldwin I of Constantinople met his death as a prisoner of King Kaloyan of Bulgaria.

#### Residential and Religious Buildings

During the Middle Ages, the slopes of Tsarevets Hill housed numerous residential buildings, craftsman's workshops, churches, and monasteries. Archaeologists have discovered over 400 residential buildings, differentiated into quarters, 22 churches, and 4 monasteries.

### Execution Rock

Tsarevets Hill is also the location of Execution Rock, an outcropping over the Yantra River. Traitors were pushed to their deaths from this rock, with their bodies falling into the river below. Patriarch Joachim was executed here by Tsar Theodore Svetoslav in 1300.

### Sound and Light Show

The Sound and Light Show is an audiovisual show that takes place in the evening. It employs three lasers, variegated lights, dramatic music, and church bells to narrate the story of Tarnovo's fall to the Ottomans and other key moments in Bulgarian history. The large-scale show has been organized at Tsarevets since 1985, when the 800-year anniversary of the Uprising of Asen and Peter was celebrated. Valo Radev and Jaromir Hnik led a Bulgarian-Czechoslovak team that designed and planned the show.

### Conclusion

Tsarevets is a significant historical site in Bulgaria, serving as the stronghold of the Second Bulgarian Empire for more than two centuries. Today, it stands as a popular tourist attraction, showcasing the rich history and architectural marvels of the medieval period. From the palace and patriarchate to the Sound and Light Show, Tsarevets offers visitors an unforgettable journey into Bulgaria's past.
