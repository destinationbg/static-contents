## Rila Monastery "Sveti Ivan Rilski"

The Monastery of Saint John of Rila, also known as Rila Monastery "Sveti Ivan Rilski," is a significant Eastern Orthodox monastery located in the southwestern Rila Mountains of Bulgaria. The monastery is named after its founder, the hermit Ivan of Rila (876 – 946 AD), and is situated in the deep valley of the Rilska River ("Rila River") inside the Rila Monastery Nature Park. It is the largest and most famous Eastern Orthodox monastery in Bulgaria, housing around 60 monks.

### Historical Significance

Founded in the 10th century, the Rila Monastery is considered one of Bulgaria's most important cultural, historical, and architectural monuments. It has been supported and respected by Bulgarian rulers throughout history, and almost every tsar of the Second Bulgarian Empire made large donations to the monastery, making it a cultural and spiritual center of Bulgarian national consciousness.

The oldest buildings in the complex date back to the first half of the 14th century, during the reign of Tsar Peter I (927-968). The arrival of the Ottomans in the late 14th century led to numerous raids and the destruction of the monastery in the mid-15th century. It was rebuilt in the late 15th century with the help of donations from the Sultana Mara Branković, the Russian Orthodox Church, and the Rossikon monastery of Mount Athos.

During the Bulgarian National Revival (18th-19th century), the monastery was destroyed by fire in 1833 and then reconstructed between 1834 and 1862 with the help of wealthy Bulgarians from across the country, under the famous architect Alexi Rilets.

### Architectural Features

The complex occupies an area of 8,800 m² and is rectangular in form, centered on the inner yard (3,200 m²), where the tower and the main church are situated. The main church of the monastery was built in the mid-19th century and has five domes, three altars, and two side chapels. One of the most precious items inside the church is the gold-plated iconostasis, famous for its wood-carving, the creation of which took five years by four handicraftsmen.

The frescoes in the church are the work of many masters from Bansko, Samokov, and Razlog, including the famous brothers Zahari Zograf and Dimitar Zograf. The church is also home to many valuable icons, dating from the 14th to the 19th century. Porticos in the courtyard have Mamluk influence with the striped painting and the domes, which became more popular in the Ottoman Empire after the conquest of Egypt.

The four-story (not counting the basement) residential part of the complex consists of 300 chambers, four chapels, an abbot's room, and other service premises.

### Tourist Attraction

The Rila Monastery is a key tourist attraction in Bulgaria, attracting around 900,000 visitors in 2008 alone. It is depicted on the reverse of the 1 lev banknote, issued in 1999. The monastery complex is regarded as one of the foremost masterpieces of Bulgarian National Revival architecture and was declared a national historical monument in 1976. It became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 and has been entirely subordinate to the Holy Synod of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church since 1991.

### Notable Visitors

Over the years, Rila Monastery has welcomed many notable visitors from around the world, including Pope John Paul II, who visited the monastery during his pilgrimage to Bulgaria in 2002. The monastery also served as a hiding place for Bulgarian revolutionaries during the Ottoman rule.
