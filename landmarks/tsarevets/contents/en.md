## Tsarevets: A Medieval Stronghold in Northern Bulgaria

Tsarevets is a historical site located in Veliko Tarnovo, northern Bulgaria. It is a medieval fortress on a hill with the same name, towering 206 metres (676 ft) above sea level. The site served as the primary fortress and strongest bulwark of the Second Bulgarian Empire from 1185 to 1393. Today, it is a popular tourist attraction, visited by many who are interested in Bulgaria's rich history.
History of Tsarevets

The hill of Tsarevets has a long and storied past. The earliest evidence of human presence on the hill dates back to the 2nd millennium BC. In the 4th century, it was settled, and a Byzantine city was constructed near the end of the 5th century. Construction of the Bulgarian stronghold began in the 12th century. After the establishment of the Second Bulgarian Empire with its capital in Veliko Tarnovo, the fortress became the most important one in Bulgaria, often compared with Rome and Constantinople in magnificence.

However, in 1393, the fortress was besieged by Ottoman forces for three months before finally being conquered and burnt down on 17 July, which marked the fall of the Bulgarian Empire.

### Layout of Tsarevets

Tsarevets has three entrances. The main entrance is located on the easternmost side of the hill. The castle complex is located in the centre, surrounded by an internal stone wall, two battle towers and two entrances - north and south. It consists of a throne hall, a castle church and the king's chamber. The whole stronghold is girdled by thick walls reaching up to 3.6 metres (12 ft) and was served by three gates. The palace is on the hill's central and plain part, which was a closed complex encircled by a fortified wall, two towers and two entrances, a main one from the north and one from the south. It featured a throne room, a palace church and a royal residential part and encompassed 4,872 square metres (52,440 sq ft).

On the top of the hill is the patriarchate, a complex with an area of about 3,000 square metres (32,000 sq ft). The Cathedral of the Ascension of the Lord, built on the remains of a late Roman basilica, was reconstructed in 1981 and painted in 1985.

### Other Structures and Attractions

Baldwin's Tower is a modern reconstruction of a medieval tower modeled after the tower in Cherven and built in 1930. It is in the southeastern part of the fortress and is at the place of the original medieval tower where Latin Emperor Baldwin I of Constantinople found his death as a prisoner of Kaloyan of Bulgaria.

During the Middle Ages, residential buildings, craftsman's workshops and numerous churches and monasteries were situated on the slopes of the Tsarevets hill. Archaeologists have discovered 400 residential buildings, differentiated in quarters, over 22 churches and 4 monasteries. Execution Rock is also located on the hill, an outcropping over the Yantra River from which traitors were pushed to their deaths.

The Sound and Light audiovisual show is an attraction carried out in the evening that uses three lasers, variegated lights, dramatic music and church bells to tell the story of the fall of Tarnovo to the Ottomans. The large-scale show has been organized at Tsarevets since 1985.
